[house of terror - cadaver the corpse]
grrruaaaaaauuggghhh
brwaaaouugughghhhhhhhh
*cough cough*
oh dear sorry about that, i had something stuck in my throat
where was i again, oh yes!
greetings! and welcome to the spooooooky corner
my name is cadaver the corpse
now that youre here, would you be so kind to help me prepare my meal
well im afriad, have no choice but to help me, unless YOU want to be my meal
just help me find 3 brains and i might let you get out of here alive





[garden of blight- maxima the malevolent]
oh.. uh.. hi
im max.. i havnt be feeling myself lately
go away
..........
oh wait, of course.. youre stuck here with me
ever since i lost my flame ive been unable to light up the garden
and without any light the poison ivys cant grow, the man-eaters cant see any prey
and worst of you cant even find your way out of this place in such darkness!
now the fire lizards are running rampant, scorching all of my wicked abominations
nasty little pests they are- oh wait thats it, firelizards! if you found one you could use it to relight my burning passion for evil!
thats it, grab the torch and once you find one, let go of the torch and click on the firelizard to catch it for me!





[hall of bones -king kalvaria the krooked]
my name is king kalvaria the krooked and i am the HEAD of this place
and i used to be much more than the head, ya know
had an pelvise, spine... a whole load of ribs...
its just that i lost all my other bones
do you think you could give me a hand... and the other one.. also some feet?
you see when you live in a room surrounded by body parts you tend to forget which are yours
you should be able to find in here my spine, ribcage, pelvis, arms and legs

[swap pelvis for head]
oh dear what have you done?
youve flipped upside down?
oh gosh no, I'VE flipped upside down
this feels so wrong please put me back
please just put me to normal and ill give you a treat
i promise!!!
