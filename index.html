				my name is sacha and this is the place on the web where i share my
				thoughts, artwork and software. im not interested in centralised social
				media, i think its cool for people to have their own websites. i love to
				write software, so do have a look at my 
				<a href="projects.html">
					<span class=rainbow>
						<span class="a1">p</span><span class="a2">r</span><span class="a3">o</span><span class="a4">j</span><span class="a5">e</span><span class="a6">c</span><span class="a7">t</span><span class="a8">s</span></span></a>

				artworks are in the
				<a href="gallery.html"><span class=rainbow><span class="a1">g</span><span class="a2">a</span><span class="a3">l</span><span class="a4">l</span><span class="a5">e</span><span class="a6">r</span><span class="a7">y</span></span></a>.

				i also love animals. i really like the way that they are classified in
				different species, genera, families and such. and its as if there arent
				enough animals as I am also interested in paleontology, the stuff about
				extinct ones, i love the process that people go through to not only discover
				but understand how they lived
			</p>
			<p>
				My favorite types of animals are arthropods, which includes insects,
				arachnids and even crustaceans.<br>
				My top 5 arthropods are:
			</p>
				<ol>
					<li>opabinia</li>
					<li>woodlouse</li>
					<li>moth</li>
					<li>blue death feigning beetle</li>
					<li>lobster</li>
				</ol>
