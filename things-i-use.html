	<h1 id="do"> things i use </h1>
	<h2> system </h2>
	<h3>gnu/linux (arch)</h3>
		<p>
			i use arch for my desktop operating system as it has all the latest packages, plus it has pretty
			much everything in the aur. the minimal approach to arch is good for me as i want
			to only install what i need and speaking of minimalism i have been looking
			into alternatives to systemd, as well as any benefits these alternatives may
			have (im not in favour of just pointlessly hating systemd just because some
			people think its cool to do so)
		</p>
		<h3>gnu/linux (debian)</h3>
		<p>
			debian for my servers because its stable and is a common choice so theres
			lots of support for it
		</p>
		<h3>dwm</h3>
		<p>
			dwm is a tiling window manager that makes me and my system faster as it is configured with vi keybindings
			which i find easier to use and it is very lightweight. i dont think that
			the quirk of configuring the program through the editing of its source code is
			necessary but i do like how simple the program is overall
		</p>
		<h3>firefox</h3>
		<p>
			although firefox is a free(dom respecting) browser it comes with weird
			telemetry which id rather just turn of as it has no benefit to me. i do this with the arkenfox user.js configuration.
			firefox is still unusable in this state. i fix it with the following extensions:
			<ul>
				<li>ublock origin (ad and javascript blocker)</li>
				<li>vimium-ff (vi keybindings)</li>
				<li>dark reader (dark theme)</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<h3>vscodium and neovim</h3>
		<p>
			neovim is a free and modern implementation of vi. it has lots of features
			for basic text editing and can be extended with plugins to cater for
			different use cases. my reasons for using vi is that it is lightweight and i
			find it comfortable to use. neovim can be a pain to configure sometimes so i
			usually fallback on vscodium. vscode is commonly mistaken for free
			software however what gets distributed by microsoft is a proprietary fork of
			a piece of free software, similarly to how the chrome and edge browsers are
			proprietary forks of chromium. the proprietary fork contains some telemetry
			that i have nothing to gain from. i just use the free version.
		</p>
		<h3>blender</h3>
		<p>
			blender is probably one of the coolest pieces of software ever written,
			despite being hard to learn at first. all my 3d models are made in it. if i
			ever get into video editing i will probably use blender for this as well, for things too
			complicated for ffmpeg
		</p>
		<h3>krita</h3>
		<p>
			all of my artwork is made in krita and i also use krita for simple image
			editing. i have never liked gimp as i found it hard to use and well kiki is
			cuter than wilbur so checkmate
		</p>
		<h2> programming languages </h2>
		<h3>java</h3>
		<p>
			java is my go to language as it is the one i used to learn how to program on
			a larger and more practical scale as opposed to just simple scripts i had
			previously written in python. i am pretty imprinted onto java because of this.
			i may change my preference later
		</p>
		<h3>bash</h3>
		<p>
			i love to use bash for simple scripts and automating tasks on gnu/linux. there
			are a lot of things made to solve certain problems that could be replaced with a
			simple shell script
		</p>
		<h3>c</h3>
		<p>
			i have taken an interest in c as a lot of the most significant programs i use are
			typically in c. i am learning it to gain a more fundamental understanding of
			how programming works as it is sometimes refered to as a mid level language, requiring
			more knowledge of the systems hardware
		</p>
		<h2> licenses </h2>
		<h3>gnu general public license version 3</h3>
		<p>
			i like to write free software (software that respects the users freedom, this statement is not related to cost)
			and i use the gpl as it is copyleft, i would
			like to share with other people if they share with everyone else. also i
			think version 3 in particular is important to prevent tivoization, the locking
			down of specific devices, despite the programs on that device being free
		</p>

	<article class="list-of-things">
	<h1 id="dont"> things i dont use </h1>
	<h3>proprietary software</h3>
		<p>
			i dont use proprietary software as i would rather be in control over the
			software i use. which means i want the freedom to run, modify and distribute
			software. i will rarely exercise the freedoms however because i dont need
			to, people more or less want the same thing, to not have software do any
			spooking tracking, to not artificially restrict the user and to not contain
			any backdoors. a program simply being free makes it very difficult for these
			features to exist in the first place with free software, as everyone has the ability to identify
			and remove them, so end users will rarely have
			to do any work themselves
		</p>
		<p>
			a lot of open source people will say how convenient it is for developers to 
			have the freedom to run, modify and distribute the source code of programs, and it is true, it is convenient from a software development standpoint, 
			but a non trivial amount of the same people
			will neglect the same freedom for the end users of such software, including
			themselves with software they are end users of. which is typically done with
			permissive licenses (mit, bsd), these licenses allow for forks to take away theses freedoms by giving them
			proprietary licenses. i believe that users should have the same freedom
			but not for the sake of convenience (although its a nice extra) but rather so
			they have control of their own computing instead of the developer having
			control over the users computing and by extension the user themselves.
		</p>
		<p>
			i do use open source software, not because its open source, but because its
			free software. free software holds pretty much the same ideas as open source
			software, without neglecting end users
		</p>
	<h3>mice</h3>
		<p>
			i find it a lot more confortable to use the keyboard in almost all
			situations i use a computer for, with the exception of a few things like 3d
			modeling and drawing. most of the software i use can be used to its full
			functionality with the keyboard, this means i use a lot of terminal programs.
			using a terminal isnt about being a '1337 h4x0r',
			terminal interfaces actually do provide some real advantages over graphic programs, namely
			the aforementioned ease of use with keyboards, aswell as: being lightweight in design
			that makes it easy to learn how to use and maintain, consistency, granular
			control and ability to automate tasks.
		</p>
		<p>
			a lot of people say the the keyboard is a much faster tool in a system optimised 
			for its use, im not sure how true this is but i use the keyboard
			for the sake of comfort. maybe i am faster with the keyboard over long
			periods due to less fatigue.
		</p>
		<p>
			touch pads are obviously worse. i havnt tried trackball mice yet. i still
			think i would prefer using the keyboard in a keyboard optimised system
			however
		</p>
	<h3>phones</h3>
		<p>
			ive always found mobiles phones inconvenient to use.
			i have never really liked touch screen as a means of input, maybe
			because i also dont like mice or maybe because my first phone was a
			blackberry curve 9300 and its what i grew used to but this reason is trivial.
			one of the problems with phones is that most of them are completely locked down, 
			the boot loader is locked so you cant change the os and they can also be locked
			into certain service providers, and you also dont
			have root access to the os. tech has regressed so far that accessing the root
			user of an os is seen as some weird illegal hacker thing.
		</p>
		<p>
			even if phones didnt have all of the mentioned antifeatures, phones make
			themselves a burden as they are too easily accessible when in a pocket, they become a distraction.
			chronic phone users are the first to admit this but i dont think they realise how 
			antisocial it is to constantly be distracted by their phone, blinding them
			to their immediate surroundings. its boring to be around someone whos
			always on their phone
		</p>
		<p>
			as phones are not made equally to desktops and laptops, they also effect behavoir on a conscious level
			as well. the design of phones are good for scrolling through social media all day long, thats
			all what most people can use them for (i said it was concious behavoir but i don think someone on 
			their 2nd hour of reddit can even be considered conscious anymore).
			if you give one child a laptop and another a phone for them to use for fun, the one with the laptop
			has the potential to do so many more cool and interesting things, 
			like: creating artwork, programming, music production, writing, video editing, animation. things
			that are actually real computer related hobbies, scrolling through tik tok 
			isnt a hobby. these things are technically possible to do on phones but are at a very limited scale, mostly due to software 
			and hardware limitations: lower performance, locked down os, smaller screen and no keyboard.
			computers can be used for social media too but atleast they have the potential for good.
		</p>
		<p>
			unfortunately its hard to go without a phone. i have a fairphone 3+ with /e/os.
			if im not expecting a call i wont bring it with me outsite in most cases,
			phones are helpful in emergancy situations, if i do bring it with me its off and
			in my bag.
		</p>
	<h3>"smart" things</h3>
		<p>
			smart things are things that dont need to be computers that are turned into computers.
			some of the most pointless smart things are smart tvs and speakers. if i wanted a
			tv or speaker to behave like i computer, i would just plug it into a computer. 
			smart things are some of the worst cases of bloat that create a larger attack surface
			on a network, each with their own 
			proprietary code and neglectful proprietors who will stop pushing security updates
			after a few years. 
			there is the old running joke
			in computer security that you can block all possible forms of malware and malicious
			connections with 100% certainty by simply just disconnecting from the internet.
			this seriously is the best solution for smart things, as internet connectivity
			as a requirement is superfluous.
		</p>
		<p>
			the voice assistant things like alexa and whatever google's one is called have spooked
			a lot of people. its worth noting how that this exact voice listening software have
			already been around in smart phones since they have contained voice assistants. even if 
			your phone isnt smart, the snowden leaks have shown how people can be listened to 
			anyway with the way more primative cellular network technology, the same tech which is the
			inherit defining feature of what makes a phone a phone.
		</p>
	<h3>social media</h3>
		<p>
			if you want an existance online you are dependant on a lot of organisations and technologies, but one of these 
			is completely artificial and almost always unnecessary, social media. the web provides all
			of the infrastructure needed for people to make themselves known throughout the internet, you can make a website
			and people can connect to you this way, this is how the web was designed to be but people have opted for a more
			centralised approach where they get permission from a social media company to exist on the web.
			i think independence is very important which is why i own my own website. i dont blame people for using social media
			as sometimes its the only way to be heard and it is especially true for things like video sharing, where the bandwidth
			required to distribute videos is expensive but i think most people can use their own websites 
			for simple things like sharing text and images.
		</p>
		<p>
			social media can be harmful and they are often deliberately designed this way because its also profitable. many instagram users
			develop body image issues, these issues will always exist but it is severely worsened by algorithms of social 
			media that can be used to promote certain things at the discretion of its proprietors.

			going back to simple personal html/css webistes without hundreds of lines of javascript will do a lot of good for people in this sense.
			i have always liked minimal websites and almost all of my favoute websites have a domain name ending in ".html".
			if something larger scale is needed there are cool static site generators like hugo. these methods might not be good for 
			large scale businesses but are perfect for individuals.
			it doesnt require any programming knowledge to build and maintain a website, and it shouldnt.
			i set up my website with the following guide <a href="https://landchad.net" target="_blank">https://landchad.net/</a>,
			html and css can be learnt quite easily whilst building a simple site
		</p>
	<h3>"the cloud"</h3>
		<p>
			i dont use "the cloud" because i want to own my files, rather than need an
			internet connection and permission from a company to access them. this doesn't
			just include data storage but also services where they sell a subscription to
			access files instead of just offering a one time download to store them on your computer,
			e.g. netflix. i think netflix does actually allow you to download videos in a 
			weird proprietary file format that can only be opened by a proprietary netflix
			client. this isnt good enough for me.
		</p>
		<p>
			im not against accessing files over the internet of course, its just a matter of ownership.
			there is free software like nextcloud, that you can run on your server,
			that can serve files to clients, which is cool but i dont personally use it.
