				my name is sacha and this is the place on the web where i share my

				i also love animals. i really like the way that they are classified in
				different species, genera, families and such. and its as if there arent
				enough animals as I am also interested in paleontology, the stuff about
				extinct ones, i love the process that people go through to not only discover
				but understand how they lived
			</p>
			<p>
				My favorite types of animals are arthropods, which includes insects,
				arachnids and even crustaceans.<br>
				My top 5 arthropods are:

					<li>opabinia</li>
					<li>woodlouse</li>
					<li>moth</li>
					<li>blue death feigning beetle</li>
					<li>lobster</li>
