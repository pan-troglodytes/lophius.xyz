	<h1> "if you're not paying for the product, you are the product"</h1>


	<h2>one of the greatest lies of our time</h2>
	<p>

first of all, it must be noted that people will typically say this about
social media but these services are not the only things that can
do this, any kind of software can.
this statement pretty much just claims that the price of a product, in this
case software, is a metric for determining if said software has any malicious
features, namely spyware, which turns the user into the product (the method of
making money) at their expense, as their privacy is violated.
the statement is partially true, there is loads of software that you dont have
to pay for that have surveillance features, such as the google chrome web
browser, discord messaging service, the windows operating system (few features
are missing without a license key) and apple's itunes, to name a few.
this seems to make sense at first but ultimately this is a narrow way of
thinking. it turns out that paying software developers does not wash away any
malicious intent or greed, after selling software there is still more money to
be made by exploiting the user, turning the user into the used
</p>
<p>
if the statement's rule were to be followed, the user would fall victim to 
paid software like the adobe suite, microsoft office and ironically antimalware
software like mcaffe, all of which collect data on its users, which means the
users are the product as well as the software, despite the monetary cost. paying for
software can also lead to more surveillance as software will usually encourage
users to use identifying methods of payment like credit cards or paypal. to
make things worse the user will be missing out on loads of software with no
surveillance features that dont cost any money such as the icecat web 
browser, xmpp messaging protocol and vlc media player

<p>
	a lot of people want a quick and easily solution to the problem of malicious
	software but its unfortunately not that simple
</p>
<h2>so then what is the solution?</h2>

<p>
you may have noticed i have been avoiding the word "free" to describe software
you dont have to pay for. thats because in the 1980s Richard Matthew Stallman
(known by his initials "rms") started using the word free to describe software
that respects the freedom of its users. free software is software that can be
ran, modified and distributed by any user (this is what this article refers to
when talking about 'free' software). these conditions make it very
difficult for malware such as surveillance to exist as users can identify these
problems by viewing the program's source code, modify it to no longer contain
them and distribute the modified copies to everyone. my point is: 
<b> the only way to tell if youre the product is to look at the code</b> (or 
talk to someone trustworthy who has), this can only be done with free
software, which also gives users the necessary power to remove
malicious features
</p>
<p>
rms had known this for all this time so in 1984 he began development of a free
operating system called gnu which was completed with the addition of the linux
kernel, developed Linus Torvalds, making a complete gnu/linux operating system
in 1992. this is one of the greatest accomplishments of our lifetime, creating
a free implementation of one of the most significant pieces of software we use,
an operating system, giving us control over our computing.
users must look towards free software if they dont want to be a
product, regardless of how much money it costs. it turns out most
free software doesnt cost any money however, as its difficult to monetize the
distribution of software that everyone is free to distribute. it goes to show
that there really are genuinely good people out like rms who are willing to do
whats right. if a user doesnt want to be a product they can find free software
<a href="https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/Main_Page">here</a> and there are
various guides on the web on how to install gnu/linux
